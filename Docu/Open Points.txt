Open Points and wish list :-) :
-------------------------------

Mechanical:
- belt: ability to strengthen them with a screw (tension)
- linear rod extension (coupled Y motors)
- More solid down camera case
- metal brackets for X axis (some are still 3D printed and lasercut plywood)
- Reduce magnets for L PCB holder (issue with magnetic parts like FETs)

Electronics:
- New place for LCD (with all feeders mounted)
- Fix electronic parts on ground plate
- better loose part picking bins
- noise containment for vacuum pump
- adding pressure sensors
- parts might 'hang' on nozzle: add pressure to 'release' it

Auto-Feeder
- Redesign to be able to move over it with the camera
- step size of feeder (2mm vs. 4mm)
- Metal or non-3D printed gears
- integrated roll holder for easier feeder exchange
- QR code for feeders
- Improve tension of coverage tape

Features:
- LED ligths/WS2812B
- solder paste dispenser with camera
- vibration motor for loose part picking
- 2nd nozzle changer
